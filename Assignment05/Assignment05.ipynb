    "## ** Important: ** When handing in your homework:\n",
    "+ Hand in the notebook (and nothing else) named as follows: StudentName1_snumber_StudentName2_snumber.ipynb\n",
    "+ Provide clear and complete answers to the questions below under a separate header (not hidden somewhere in your source code), and make sure to explain your answers / motivate your choices. Add Markdown cells where necessary.\n",
    "+ Source code, output graphs, derivations, etc., should be included in the notebook.\n",
    "+ Hand-in: upload to Blackboard.\n",
    "+ Include name, student number, assignment (especially in filenames)!\n",
    "+ When working in pairs only one of you should upload the assignment, and report the name of your partner in your filename.\n",
